"""The two ways to see what the library is doing: an `observer` per statement,
and `logging.getLogger("rowform")` at DEBUG.

Both exist because a service needs to answer "which query was slow" without
reaching into a `CoreQuery`, and because there was previously no way to answer it
at all — the library imported `logging` nowhere.

The hook is on the caller's path, so the cost of *not* using it is part of the
contract: `observer=None` is one attribute load and a branch per statement, and
nothing per row.
