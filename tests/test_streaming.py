"""`fetch_iter`: the same rows as `fetch_all`, a chunk at a time.

Run against both backends, because the three drivers stream through three
different primitives — `fetchmany` on a sqlite cursor, a portal on asyncpg, a
`DECLARE`d cursor on psycopg — and the interesting failures are per-driver:
asyncpg refuses to open a portal outside a transaction (so the engine opens one),
and postgres refuses to `DECLARE` a cursor for a write with RETURNING (so
`PsycopgEngine` says so rather than passing on a syntax error).

`fetch_all` is the oracle throughout: a stream that does not agree with it,
row for row and type for type, is broken however elegantly it chunks.
