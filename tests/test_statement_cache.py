"""The compiled-statement cache is bounded, and evicts the least recently used.

`fetch_all` compiles a bare statement once and keeps it under SQLAlchemy's
structural cache key. That key is structural, so an application whose statements
vary in *shape* per request mints a new one every time, and an uncapped dict held
every one of them for the life of the process.

Note what does *not* grow it: `Author.id.in_([...])` compiles to a single
expanding placeholder, so every list length shares one key. The shape that grows
is a varying number of clauses, which is what these tests build.

Eviction is by least-recent *use*, not by insertion: a plain cap would throw out
whatever compiled first, which in a long-lived service is its startup statements.
